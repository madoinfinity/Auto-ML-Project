# Auto-ML-Project

This project proposes a multi-agentic AutoML framework powered by fine-tuned Gemini models to help SMEs convert business problems into data-driven solutions. The system includes specialized agents for prompt refinement, ML code generation, data analysis, and final report synthesis. It begins with an interactive model that understands the user's business context and clarifies the problem. Subsequent agents generate code for machine learning and visualization tasks based on user data. Finally, a reporting agent combines insights into a comprehensive output. The framework emphasizes usability, automation, and adaptability for non-technical users.

The project code itself can not be shared as the project is ongoing, however an evaluation script is shared to show the performance of our agents by using LLM as a judge.
